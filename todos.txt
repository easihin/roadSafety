- quick deceleration sends something to you (1 minute then call emergency no. + contact)
- if upside down or on it's side (256 (?) call emergency number)
- fully submerged -> call
- hydroplaning 
    - at which speed does hydroplaning occur (threshold) -> slow down
    - instruct to turn the wheel in a certain direction
    - tell them what speed is safe

- calculating the roll (how much will cause the tipping over)

- predict sketchy road
    - get lat, long
    - plug into google maps
    - figure out the direction of the driving
    - figure out the roads ahead
